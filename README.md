# STEP - Final Challenge Example

> Please note that this example was taken from a previous graduate's final challenge and may therefore contain
issues such as in-correct formatting and messy implementations. This project should by no means be taken as a
best practice coding example!

## Getting Started

In order to get the example up and running follow these steps:

1) Clone the project and navigate into the root
2) Perform ``npm install``
3) Navigate into the uimodule directory and perform an ``npm install``
4) Navigate back to the root and run the ``npm run db:sqlite`` command to initialize the local database
5) From here, run the service module by performing an ``npm run dev``
6) Open a second terminal shell and navigate into the uimodule directory
7) Now run the ``npm run start`` command to open the UI

Happy coding!
